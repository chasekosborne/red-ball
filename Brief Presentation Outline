The professor said the presentation needs to contain these elements approximately in this order:

1. The presentation itself should be 3-5 minutes long and should have around 3-5 slides
2. A 10-second(ish) long summary of the game we are working on
3. An image of our kanban board for the week
4. An image of our issues list (doesn't have to be entire thing)
5. Discussion of features implemented and progress completed
6. Live demo of what was discussed in the previous step.
